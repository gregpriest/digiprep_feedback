 It was good on basic intro to github.  I'm not as clear what I would want to use it for if I am not programming or collaborating.  The forking and branching stuff was reasonably clear, but the basic background was lacking.  I assume that everyone else was more sophisticated than I am about why one would want to use GH.  It may be that there was just a wide array of experience levels, and impossible to fit them all together.  Thanks!.  See you next time.
